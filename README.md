# Fructus

## A SwiftUI project

Getting more familiar with SwiftUI techniques for typical UI functions
Passing Data from one view to another, simple animations for disclosure groups and other
animation of images for effect.

The design & assets were part of a Udemy course I took to get more familiar with SwiftUI.

The fruit data was pretty much all from wiki's, but not implemented through any kind of 
data decoding or serialization from JSON objects.
